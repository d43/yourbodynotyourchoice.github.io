				<h2>Counseling</h2>

				<p>Terminating a pregnancy is a difficult choice. Counseling as an option to both inform and help a patient through such an emotional process is an invaluable asset that women considering an abortion should have access to. Mandated counseling goes beyond that, requiring doctors to present information designed to discourage a woman from seeking abortion.</p>

				<p>The issue of mandated counseling is further exacerbated by the overwhelming presence of crisis pregnancy centers (CPC) in comparison to abortion providers. CPCs provide useful services like free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, diapers, parenting classes, and sometimes even housing, but also have a reputation for misinformation and are not medically licensed.[8]</p>

				<p>They actively disseminate erroneous and/or false information to women seeking advice regarding pregnancy. These include dubious claims of links between abortion, breast cancer and female infertilitiy, that condoms are ineffective, that abortion pills are dangerous, that abortions lead to permanent psychological damage, that abortion is dangerous and could kill the patient, and many more unsubstantiated claims.[9]</p>

				<p>Despite that approach and their reputation, CPCs received $60 million of federal funding by 2006 and at present outnumber legitimate Abortion Clinics by about 700.[10] CPCs are eligible for the funding because their primary mission is to promote abstinence, though the link between womenâ€™s counseling, abstinence, and abortion are hard to deny. In multiple cases, CPCs set up signage or establishments near to Planned Parenthood that leaves off their affiliation, leading to confusion from women seeking accurate information.[11]</p>

				<p>Whereas CPCs are directly assisted by state governments, Abortion Providers are subjected in 45 states by restrictions which are not imposed on other medical professionals. These are referred to as Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP laws. Common TRAP laws require doctors to convert their practices to mini-hospitals at great expense, limit abortion care to hospitals or other specialized facilities or physicians offices, and/or require doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital with nothing requiring facilities to grant that privilege.[12]</p>

				<p>As a result, in many states Abortion Providers can only exist in large cities, while CPCs thrive in the small towns and rural areas.</p>
