				<p>The first major blow to Roe v. Wade came in 1991 with the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the US Supreme Court questioned whether Pennsylvania’s laws requiring informed consent, 24 hour waiting periods, and parental consent violated Roe v. Wade. Despite upholding Roe v. Wade, the court also affirmed all of Pennsylvania’s laws except for one, which required the father being informed.</p>

				<p>This decision set the new standard: Abortion regulation is fine, provided it doesn’t impose “undue burden” on a woman seeking abortion; undue burden defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”[3]</p>

				<p>From that vague decision all of the following restrictions became validated.</p>

				<h3>Partial Birth</h3>

				<p>In 2003, the U.S. Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007. The law prohibits abortions via the “partial-birth abortion” procedure. Coined by the National Right to Life Committee in 1995, it originally referred to a specific type of abortion called the “intact dilation and evacuation".</p>

				<p>In the ruling, however, the term doesn't refer to any precise medical procedure, but rather any abortion where the doctor “deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire head is outside the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother.”[4]</p>

				<p>The issue here is that the ban completely disregards cases where the woman's health may be at risk. In cases where the fetus develops an illness undetectable until the second trimester, procedures banned by this law are widely considered the safest way to end the pregnancy without damaging the woman's cervix. The negligence of the law is addressed in 32 states with exceptions, but in 29 those exceptions are only made when the woman's life is in danger.[5]</p>

				<h3>Trigger laws</h3>

				<p>Due to Roe v. Wade, it is illegal for states to not provide abortions if the woman's life is endangered. However, many states still have laws which, while unenforceable, are still on the books from before 1973. Some states have even passed laws which won’t come into effect unless Roe v. Wade is overturned.[6]</p>

				<p>These laws are nicknamed “Trigger Laws:” A law that is unenforceable at present, but may become relevant if a “trigger event”, in this case Roe being overturned, occurs. Because of this, the trigger laws can only themselves be overturned through the state legislature after going into effect.[7]</p>
