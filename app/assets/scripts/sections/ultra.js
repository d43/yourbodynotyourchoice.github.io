        <h2>Mandatory Ultrasound</h2>
        <p>The most recent type of state legislation introduced to restrict abortion are for mandatory ultrasounds. An ultrasound is a medical procedure that sends high frequency sound waves through a pregnant woman's body to create an image of the fetus inside.[17] For observations of the fetus's development, ultrasounds are great.</p>
        <p>Initially introduced in the late 1980â€™s, state legislation regarding ultrasounds has become more prevalent since 2004. These laws range from simply requiring doctors to inform a woman of the procedure, to requiring it to be offered, to mandatory prior to an abortion.</p>

        <p>Ultrasounds are not a medically necessary component of a first-trimester abortion. When they become a requirement, they add another hurdle to the process. Further intrusive is the policy in Louisiana, Texas, and Virginia that require the ultrasound image to be shown and described during the ultrasound procedure. While patients are allowed to look away or close their eyes, depending on the circumstances of the abortion, it can be an emotionally painful experience.</p>

        <p>Mandatory ultrasounds replace informed-consent with coercion. Not about the ultimate decision, but how a woman chooses to get there.[18]</p>
