      <h2>Parental Consent</h2>
      <p>The majority of teenagers under the age of 18 who have abortions involve at least one parent. The teens who choose not to inform their parents generally have a good reason not to do so. In those cases, concerns include getting kicked out of the home, mistrust based on parents' previous actions, or abuse. While these may be rare cases, they've been shown to be legitimate.[15]</p>
      <p>All states that mandate parental consent allow for exceptions from a judge or doctor, but finding them and obtaining their consent can be a very time consuming process in a very time-sensitive situation. There is no evidence that mandated consent has an influence on parental involvement.[16]</p>
