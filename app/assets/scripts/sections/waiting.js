				<h2>Waiting Periods</h2>

				<p>In all states, before receiving an abortion, a woman needs to offer “informed” consent. This step involves being provided with the states considerd adequate information, and then in some states, a required waiting period of at least 18 hours between the counseling and the abortion.[13]</p>

				<p>There are no studies conclusively proving this waiting period helps with the decision, but there are multiple which point out the consequences of it. As you can see in the above map, most abortion clinics are located in major cities. One study cites an average travel distance of 42 miles necessary to travel, with the farthest being 400 miles.[14] When factoring in travel costs and stress of making the trip, intentionally or not, waiting period laws put an unnecessary burden on women in rural areas seeking abortions.</p>
